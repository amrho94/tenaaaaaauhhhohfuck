# Neon

Roblox client based on TenacityForRoblox, with a Krs-inspired UI. Written in Luau.

## Runtime

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amrho94/tenaaaaaauhhhohfuck/main/loader.lua', true))()
```

The loader uses the repository shown above. Set `shared.NeonRepository` and `shared.NeonBranch` before loading to use your own fork. The ZIP changes need to be uploaded there before the remote loader can use them.

For local use, put the contents of `Neon-client/` in your executor's `neon/` folder and run `launch-local.lua`. Profiles and cached files are stored under `neon/`.

## Files
